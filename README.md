You can predict your rank, ELO and even potential opponents and results against them.

I first created this simulator when DE just came out. It lacked many features and accuracy, but even then I made some good predictions.

Predictions (example is retrodictions, when simulation ~almost matched the reality). Check Daut:

Also I made predictions before it actually happened (TODO need to find old screenshots).

The latest version allows to import real player data.

Also you can add custom players manually.

And you can spawn random players periodically.
